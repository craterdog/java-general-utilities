 * primitive type to byte array conversions
 * cryptographically secure random number generation for specific purposes

## Highlighted Components
The following highlights the utility classes provided by this project:

 * *Base02Utils* - converts between byte arrays and base 2 strings
 * *Base16Utils* - converts between byte arrays and base 16 strings
 * *Base32Utils* - converts between byte arrays and base 32 strings
 * *Base64Utils* - converts between byte arrays and base 64 strings
 * *ByteUtils* - converts between byte arrays and primitive types
 * *RandomUtils* - generates random array indexes, probabilities, and byte arrays
